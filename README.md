# ImageFromTextTutorial

This is code if you want to create a UIImage of letters, say for the intials of a name for a contact profile picture in the absense of an actual picture. Instead of actually creating a large amount of actual pictures of each letter combination. This code takes the first letter of each word and creates an image on the fly. This will reduce your project size.
